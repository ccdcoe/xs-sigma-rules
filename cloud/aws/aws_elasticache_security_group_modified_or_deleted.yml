- A ElastiCache security group deletion may be done by a system or network administrator.
  Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes
  in your environment. Security Group deletions from unfamiliar users or hosts should
  be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted
  from the rule.
