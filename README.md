# xs-sigma-rules

[Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) transformed to our [Frankenstack](https://github.com/ccdcoe/frankenstack)'s liking.

The primary modifications compared to the original rule set are keyword changes to accomodate the logs from some of the tools we use. E.g., Suricata, Winlogbeat, Snoopy, etc.

**NB! The rules contained in this repository are released under the [Detection Rule License (DRL) 1.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdcoe/xs-sigma-rules/main/LICENSE)**
