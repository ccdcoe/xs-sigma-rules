description: Domain user and group enumeration via network reconnaissance. Seen in
  APT 29 and other common tactics and actors. Detects a set of RPC (remote procedure
  calls) used to enumerate a domain controller. The rule was created based off the
  datasets and hackathon from https://github.com/OTRF/detection-hackathon-apt29
detection:
  condition: selection | count(operation) by src_ip > 4
  selection:
    operation:
    - LsarLookupNames3
    - LsarLookupSids3
    - SamrGetGroupsForUser
    - SamrLookupIdsInDomain
    - SamrLookupNamesInDomain
    - SamrQuerySecurityObject
    - SamrQueryInformationGroup
  timeframe: 30s
falsepositives:
- Devices that may do authentication like a VPN or a firewall that looksup IPs to
  username
- False positives depend on scripts and administrative tools used in the monitored
  environment
