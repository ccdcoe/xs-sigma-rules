description: Windows telemetry makes use of the binary CompatTelRunner.exe to run
  a variety of commands and perform the actual telemetry collections. This binary
  was created to be easily extensible, and to that end, it relies on the registry
  to instruct on which commands to run. The problem is, it will run any arbitrary
  command without restriction of location or type.
