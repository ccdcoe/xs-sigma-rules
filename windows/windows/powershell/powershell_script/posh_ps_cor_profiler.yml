description: 'Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack
  the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.

  The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify
  an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process
  that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR).

  These profiliers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed
  by the .NET CLR.
