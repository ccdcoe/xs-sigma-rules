falsepositives:
- DNS zone modified and deleted may be performed by a system administrator. Verify
  whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes
  in your environment.
- DNS zone modification from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior
  is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
